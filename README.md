## 🖼️ Overview  

This project tells the **story of student life** using **OpenGL 2D graphics**.  
Each stage — from **School to College to University** — is represented through minimalist, hand-drawn scenes created using geometric primitives.  

💡 The design focuses on **clarity, precision, and emotion**, showing that even simple lines and colors can express meaningful memories.

## 🧠 Concept Summary

This project merges creativity with computation — showing that programming can be an art form.
It’s not just about drawing shapes; it’s about expressing emotion, growth, and learning through the lens of graphics and code.

“Code can tell stories — if we design with intention.”
