# 🎓 Journey of a Student Life — OpenGL 2D Graphics Project  

> A creative OpenGL project visualizing the **three stages of a student's life** — School, College, and University — through 2D art and animation in **C++**.

---

## 🖼️ Overview  

This project tells the **story of student life** using **OpenGL 2D graphics**.  
Each stage — from **School to College to University** — is represented through minimalist, hand-drawn scenes created using geometric primitives.  

💡 The design focuses on **clarity, precision, and emotion**, showing that even simple lines and colors can express meaningful memories.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 💻 **Language** | C++ |
| 🧩 **Graphics Library** | OpenGL (2D Rendering) |
| 🏗️ **IDE** | Code::Blocks |
| 🎵 **Sound Library** | Used for background music |
| 🪟 **Platform** | Windows (recommended) |

---

## ✨ Features  

- 🎨 **Three Life Stages:** School, College, University  
- 🧱 **Scene-Based Rendering:** Separate drawings for each phase  
- 🌳 **Custom Functions:** Trees, clouds, buildings, roads, buses, and more  
- 🎧 **Background Sound:** Immersive experience with ambient sound  
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Controls:** Interact with animations  
- ⏰ **Timer Events:** Smooth scene transitions using `glutTimerFunc()`  
- 🧠 **Educational Purpose:** Great for OpenGL beginners and students

🧠 Concept Summary

This project merges creativity with computation — showing that programming can be an art form.
It’s not just about drawing shapes; it’s about expressing emotion, growth, and learning through the lens of graphics and code.

“Code can tell stories — if we design with intention.”
